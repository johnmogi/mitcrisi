the start and end indicators are crude

looking at 2 products they seem to hace the same calendar info
needs to check so this wont happen and
 each will have its indivifual data reserved dates etc


also on tht cart 

<div id="date-validation-message" class="validation-message error" style="display: block;" bis_skin_checked="1">לא ניתן להזמין לשבת (מערכת סגורה)</div>
that error shouldnt be there

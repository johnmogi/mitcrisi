# Mitnafun Rental Calendar â€” Stock & Date Blocking Fixes (May 2025)

## Summary of Fixes and Key Functions

### 1. **Stock Validation & Calendar Blocking**
- **File:** `js/stock-data-integrator.js`
- **Function:** `disableBookingForZeroStock()`
    - *Purpose*: Prevents bookings when stock is 0, but allows bookings for future dates after all current reservations end.
    - *Logic*: 
        - Finds the last reserved date and allows bookings only for dates after this threshold (with a 1-day buffer).
        - Disables all past and currently reserved dates.
        - Enables future dates, so users can book for periods when the item will be available again.
    - *UI*: Shows a friendly info message if only future bookings are possible; disables booking buttons if no valid date is selected.

- **Function:** `processStockData(data)`
    - *Purpose*: Handles stock and reservation data, sets global flags, and triggers the zero-stock blocking logic.

### 2. **Date Range Validation**
- **File:** `js/date-range-validator.js`
- **Function:** `window.validateDateRange`
    - *Purpose*: Prevents users from booking invalid date ranges.
    - *Logic*: 
        - For zero-stock products, only allows booking if both start and end dates are in the future and marked as available by the calendar (class `future-available`, `early-return-date`, or `return-date`).
        - Shows a clear error message if the user tries to select an unavailable date.

### 3. **User Messaging & Button Handling**
- **UI feedback**: Calendar header turns orange for limited stock, red for full block.
- **Error/info messages**: Always shown near the date picker.
- **Button disabling**: All add-to-cart/order buttons are disabled if no valid selection is possible.

## Why the Previous (Full Block) Bypass Did Not Work

- **Previous Approach**: When stock was 0, the code disabled *all* date cells and all booking buttons, regardless of whether future dates were available or not.
- **Problem**: This prevented users from making legitimate future bookings for periods when the product would be available again (after current reservations end). This is not ideal for a rental business, as it blocks potential revenue and frustrates users.
- **Fix**: The new approach only blocks dates up to the last reservation (plus a buffer) and allows bookings for future, truly available dates. This balances stock integrity with business needs.

## Outstanding Issues / To Review
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that early-return and return dates are still handled correctly for zero-stock products.
- **UI/UX**: Confirm that users always see a clear message about why certain dates are unavailable.
- **Back-End Validation**: Ensure server-side checks also respect these rules to prevent bypass via direct POST requests.

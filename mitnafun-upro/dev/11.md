where we stand on re-integrating true reserved dates per product:

Backend Query & Endpoint
get_product_reserved_dates() (in the Order-Admin plugin) now pulls every order’s rental_dates meta for a given product, filters out past bookings, and returns JSON with reserved_dates, upcoming_dates and past_dates.
Nonce checks and error handling are in place.
Frontend Integration
On each product page, rental-dates-handler.js reads the localized bookedDates array (injected via wp_localize_script), flattens them into JS Date objects, and passes them to updateDatepicker() (or the fallback calendar).
A “Refresh” button calls refreshRentalDates() to AJAX-reload dates without page refresh.
Current Coverage
Dates already booked (from today onward) are correctly disabled in the datepicker for each individual product.
Past ranges are excluded.
The refresh flow keeps an open session in sync if an order is placed elsewhere.
Outstanding Gaps
Weekend (Shabbat) dates are still being filtered out by the core/fallback calendar validation, which cascades into price/discount logic disappearing on Saturday-inclusive ranges.
We’re currently using two different localized JS objects—mitnafunRental in the theme and mitnafunFrontend in the plugin. This mismatch can cause data to be missing if one isn’t loaded.
Next Steps
Remove the Saturday‐exclusion in fallback-calendar.js (and ensure pricing logic supports weekend ranges).
Consolidate on a single localization object (e.g. mitnafunFrontend) and update rental-dates-handler.js to use it.
Run through several product pages in the browser preview and confirm that each product’s reserved days map exactly to what’s in the WooCommerce orders.

once the user navigates months we often see reserved dates losing the 1st / end date signal

he current status of the “start/end” boundary highlighting fix:

• Localization
– All scripts now use a single mitnafunFrontend object (PHP side wires up both bookedDates and a new reservedRanges array of {start, end} pairs).

• Fallback-Calendar.js
– On init we pull in window.reservedRanges.
– In generateMonthCalendar(), cells matching a range’s start or end now get .range-start / .range-end.
– Added CSS so those edge cells stay visually distinct when you flip months.

What’s next?
– If you’re still using AirDatepicker (the primary picker), we’ll need to mirror the same boundary classes via its onChangeMonth or cell-template callbacks.
– Otherwise, the fallback calendar should now correctly preserve edge highlights across navigations.

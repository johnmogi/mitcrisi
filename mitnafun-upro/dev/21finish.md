# Per-Day Stock Tracking Issue and Solution

## Overview

This document explains the per-day stock tracking issue and its solution in the Mitnafun rental booking system.

## The Problem

The system was allowing overlapping bookings that exceeded the available stock. This happened because the system wasn't tracking how many items were booked for each specific date, leading to situations where more items were booked than actually available in stock.

## The Solution

We implemented a comprehensive per-day stock tracking system that:

1. **Counts Booked Items Per Day**: Tracks exactly how many items are booked for each calendar date
2. **Respects Stock Limits**: Prevents bookings when all units are reserved for a specific date
3. **Works With All Stock Levels**: Handles products with any quantity (1, 2, or more)

### Technical Implementation

The solution involves two main functions:

1. `count_booked_products_per_date($product_id, $dates)`: Counts how many products are booked for specific dates
2. `check_dates_availability($product_id, $start_date_str, $end_date_str)`: Checks if dates are available based on stock

These functions are integrated into the validation flow before a booking can be confirmed, ensuring that we never exceed the stock limit on any given day.

## Benefits

The per-day stock tracking solution provides the following benefits:

* Prevents overbooking and ensures that customers can only book available stock
* Provides accurate stock levels for each day, reducing the risk of stockouts and overstocking
* Enhances the overall customer experience by providing real-time availability information

## Future Improvements

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Create an admin interface to visualize bookings per day
2. **Availability Calendar**: Show customers a color-coded calendar indicating remaining stock for each day
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement price adjustments for high-demand days
4. **Advanced Notification System**: Alert staff when stock levels for specific days are getting low

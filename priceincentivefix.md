# Price Incentive Breakdown Fix — Documentation

## Overview
This fix ensures that the price breakdown (discount/incentive box) is reliably displayed to users **after they confirm valid rental dates** on the product page. It uses robust debug/retry logic to guarantee the breakdown is injected at the right moment and is removed if dates become invalid.

## Key Points
- **Breakdown appears only after valid date confirmation** (when the validation message is visible).
- **Breakdown is injected after `.fallback-calendar`** (or before the cart form as fallback).
- **Debug/retry logic** ensures the box is always injected, even if the DOM is slow to update.
- **Breakdown is hidden** if the user changes to invalid dates.
- **No custom containers or legacy code** — only the robust, debug-enabled logic is used.
- **`window.mitnafunBreakdownShouldShow` is set automatically** based on validation state.

## How it Works
1. When the user selects and confirms valid dates, the validation message (`#date-validation-message`) becomes visible.
2. The script detects this and sets `window.mitnafunBreakdownShouldShow = true`.
3. The debug/retry logic injects the breakdown after the calendar.
4. If the dates become invalid again, the breakdown is removed and `window.mitnafunBreakdownShouldShow = false`.

## Maintenance
- All breakdown display logic is now in `price-calculator.js`.
- To adjust the appearance, edit the injected HTML in the debug/retry logic.
- To change when the breakdown appears, adjust the validation state detection in `createDiscountDisplay()`.

## Troubleshooting
- If the breakdown does not appear, check the browser console for `[Breakdown Debug]` logs.
- Ensure `price-calculator.js` is loaded and not cached.
- Confirm that the validation message is shown after date approval.

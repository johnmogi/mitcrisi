כשאני רוצה לסמן איסוף שישי והחזרה בראשון אי אפשר לעבור להזמנה
אם לוקחים ב 21 לחודש ומחזירים ב 
22 זה צריך להיחשב יום אחד ולא יומיים 


יש אפשרות להוסיף שהשכרה משישי עד ראשון נחשבת כיום אחד?
weekend should count as 1 day


האם קיימת אפשרות שהלוח שנה יהיה קצת פחות אפור?😬

טופס ההזמנה אמור להיות אחרי הצק אווט

אהבתי מאוד את החלון תנאי החזרת הציוד שקופץ אחרי אישור התאריך
גם לגבי ההנחה המובנית עבור יום נוסף 

באמת יש עוד כמה דברים שצריך לעבור עליהם לפי הרשימה אבל כבר נראה טוב.. לגבי המיילים והזמינות

We tried patching one of the two loops in fallback-calendar.js (around line 1907), but the first loop (around line 825) is still unmodified. You’ll need to update both loops to skip getDay()===5 and 6 when validating.
